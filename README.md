ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
-
My name is Denis Stael,

I'm a Brazilian software developer and software engineering student.
I currently work at the [NullBug](https://nullbug.dev) software house, developing on-demand systems with technologies such as Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis and integration with AWS services.

I have experience with web and desktop development, and I am improving my knowledge with mobile development.
Other languages and frameworks that I have knowledge of are Java, Spring Framework, React, React Native and Javascript.

Here you will find some of my personal projects, there are still few (or incomplete :sweat_smile:), but I'm working on it... ðŸ¤“ hehehe 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-stael).
